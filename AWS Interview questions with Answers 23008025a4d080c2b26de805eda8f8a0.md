## Explain what this IAM policy does

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::company-data"
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "ecs:RunTask"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
     "Condition": {
        "ArnEquals": {
          "ecs:cluster": "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster/prod"
        }
      },
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:task-definition/update-tables:*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This AWS IAM policy grants permissions for two actions:

1. Allow listing objects in the S3 bucket named "company-data".
2. Allow running tasks in an ECS (Elastic Container Service) cluster named "prod" in the "us-east-1" region, specifically tasks defined by the task definition with the name prefix "update-tables".
